    The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) paved additional portion of an access road in San Jorge, Samar which can provide better access to Pinipisakan Falls.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    The P48.95-million multi-year road project was implemented by the DPWH Regional Office 8 and Samar 1st District Engineering Office (DEO), under the departmentâ€™s convergence program with the Tourism Road Infrastructure Program (TRIP).
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    DPWH Region 8 Director Edgar B. Tabacon noted that the scope of works of the tourism road project includes the construction of a 1.35-kilometer, two-lane reinforced concrete pipe culvert (RCPC) road with an 800-meter shoulder on both sides, with provision for slope protection construction.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    He stressed that the improved road conditions will make it easier for tourists to visit Pinipisakan Falls through safer and faster ground transport instead of the three-hour boat ride and hiking.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    The tourism road project is also expected to attract more travelers, business owners, and investors which will generate more jobs and create livelihood opportunities to improve the economic condition in the area, Tabacon noted.
